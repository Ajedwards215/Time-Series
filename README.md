 The Time-Series Forecasting notebook uses time series analysis and modeling to determine the predictable behavior of historical Dollar-Yen exchange rate futures data, including decomposition using the Hodrick-Prescott Filter, forecasting returns using the ARMA model, forecasting settles price using the ARIMA model, and forecasting volatility with GARCH.
 
 The analysis and modeling results are used to answer questions regarding purchasing the yen, expected risk, and confidence in the models for trading. The Linear Regression Forecasting notebook involves building a Scikit-Learn linear regression model to predict Yen futures returns, with categorical calendar seasonal effects and lagged Yen futures returns. The results are evaluated for in-sample and out-of-sample performance, and conclusions are drawn regarding the model's performance.
 
 Overall, the models for forecasting volatility look reasonably solid, but the models for predicting future yen returns and prices may require improvement before being used for financial decisions.
